			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>
				I am a student at Miami University majoring in Statistics and minoring in Computer Science. Outside of class I intern at my University's Center for Anayltics and Data Science where I complete semester long data analytics projects for clients. Through these projects, I have been able to work for one of the largest commercial banks in the Midwest as well as one of the best hospitals in the United States. I have discovered new interests through my coursework as well as my personal exploration and I am hoping to pursue a career in Software Engineering. I am actively searching for internship opportunities in this field where I can gain experience and continue to learn new things.
